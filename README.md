# Gravy - Graph Visualisation
__Gravy is now live! (<https://gravy.thud.dev>)__

![](public/images/demo.gif)

Gravy is a toy for generating graphs and visualising various algorithms on them. It allows you to create a graph by placing nodes and connections, provides support for connection weights/directions as well as the choice of a few commonly used graphs which are generated in realtime.  
Upon reaching Gravy, you will receive a walkthrough on how to use it.

## Get Started
